# Geomorphological Mapping using OBIA & Geomorphons

This repository accompanies my bachelor thesis project at the University of Amsterdam, focused on improving geomorphological classification of the Soutpansberg mountain range, using object-based image analysis (OBIA) and geomorphons techniques.


## 🗺️ Overview

This study applies classification techniques using:
- **ArcGIS Pro** for geomorphons, preprocessing and visualization
- **eCognition Developer** for OBIA segmentation and classification
- **Python scripting** (with ArcPy) for landscape parameters and project operations
- **R studio** for spatial analyses

## 📌 Notes
* Raw 30m DEM and extension polygon were sourced from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, and delivered by dr. Edmore Kori (University of Venda).
* All processing was done in ArcGIS Pro 3.4 and eCognition 10.3.
